        <h3 class="sub-heading">
            <b>Introduction</b>
        </h3>
        <div class="para">

        
        <p>Java is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, and secure programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It is formally known as OAK. In 1995, Sun Microsystem changed the name to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystem takeover by Oracle Corporation.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">
                Java Platform
            </h3>
            <p>Java Platform is a collection of programs. It helps to develop and run a program written in the Java programming language. Java Platform includes an execution engine, a compiler and set of libraries. Java is a platform-independent language.</p>
                <h3 class="sub-heading">
                    Features of Java
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    
                        <b>Simple</b>
                        <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspJava is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clean, and easy to understand. Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in Java. For example, pointer and operator overloading are not used in Java.</p>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    
                    <b>Object-Oriented</b>
                    <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn Java, everything is in the form of the object. It means it has some data and behavior. A program must have at least one class and object.</p>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="sub-heading">
                OOPs (Object Oriented Programming System)
            </h3>    
            <p>Object-oriented programming is a way of solving a complex problem by breaking them into a small sub-problem. An object is a real-world entity. It is easier to develop a program by using an object. In OOPs, we create programs using class and object in a structured manner.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Class
            </h2>
            <p>A class is a template or blueprint or prototype that defines data members and methods of an object. An object is the instance of the class. We can define a class by using the class keyword.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Object
            </h2>
            <p>An object is a real-world entity that can be identified distinctly. For example, a desk, a circle can be considered as objects. An object has a unique behavior, identity, and state. Data fields with their current values represent the state of an object (also known as its properties or attributes).</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Abstraction
            </h2>
            <p>An abstraction is a method of hiding irrelevant information from the user. For example, the driver only knows how to drive a car; there is no need to know how does the car run. We can make a class abstract by using the keyword abstract. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Encapsulation
            </h2>
            <p>An encapsulation is the process of binding data and functions into a single unit. A class is an example of encapsulation. In Java, Java bean is a fully encapsulated class.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Inheritance
            </h2>          
            <p>Inheritance is the mechanism in which one class acquire all the features of another class. We can achieve inheritance by using the extends keyword. It facilitates the reusability of the code.</p>
            <h2 class="types">
                Polymorphism
            </h2>  
            <p>
                The polymorphism is the ability to appear in many forms. In other words, single action in different ways. For example, a boy in the classroom behaves like a student, in house behaves like a son. There are two types of polymorphism: run time polymorphism and compile-time polymorphism.
            </p>
            <h3 class="sub-heading">
                Application
            </h3>
            <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.</li>
                <li>Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.</li>
                <li>Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.</li>
